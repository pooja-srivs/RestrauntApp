Restaurants Search Feature

Consider we have 2 json files.
1) Contains the restaurants list with details, cuisine types &
reviews
2) Contains the menu items of the restaurants.
Functionality to be implemented:
Search feature in the order of items/cuisine types/restaurants.
Ex:

● If a user searches with text “Biryani”, then the results should
list out all restaurants which serve Biryani.

● If a user searches with text “Indian”, then search results
should be all the restaurants of cuisine type “Indian”
irrespective of menu items.

● If a user searches with text “Shanti Sagar”, then the search
results should be all the restaurants with the name Shanti
Sagar.
Consider the app doesn’t know what exactly the user is searching, so
based on the text he types, narrow down the search results from both
data models, & give consolidated results.
Notes:

● Use below given json files for development (No need to use any API for
data).

● Search results should start displaying as user types.

● There is no API provided for this, you should use a given json sample to
create your own json file with multiple data for efficient
implementation.

● Results should show the content that matches the search text.
